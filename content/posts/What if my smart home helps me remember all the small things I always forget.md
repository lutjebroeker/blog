After years of reading productivity books and building automations in Home Assistant, Iâ€™m on the verge of putting my knowledge and skills to work for the ultimate smart assistant. My goal? To never forget groceries again and to keep challenging myself, inspired by *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* by Stephen Covey.

In this blog, I will take you along on my journey: from the very first installation of Proxmox and all applications to who knows where this adventure will lead me. I hope to live not only smarter but also better.

This is my first blog post, but stay tuned! More is coming.
