# Atomic Habits
# Samenvatting
## The fundamentals: Why tiny changes make a big difference
### 1. The surprising power of atomic habits
Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals
Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness
Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress
#### Chapter Summary
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1% better every day counts to a lot in the long run.
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding these details is essential.
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
### 2. How your habits shape your identity (and vice versa)
#### The two-step process to changing your identity
1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
#### Chapter Summary
- There are three levels of change:
	1. Outcome change
	2. Process change
	3. Identity change
- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you whish to become.
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.
### 3. How to build better habits in 4 simple steps
#### The science of how habits work
1. Cue
2. Craving

#### Chapter Summary
- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic
- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response and reward.
- The four laws of behavior change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy and (4) make it satisfying.
## The 1st law: Make it obvious
### 4. The man who didn't look right
#### Chapter Summary
- With enough practice, your brain will pick on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
- Pointing-and-Calling of raises your level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.
- [[The Habits Scorecard]] is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.
### 5. The best way to start a new habit
#### Chapter Summary
- The 1st law of behavior change is *make it obvious*.
- The two most common cues are time and location.
- Creating an implementation intention is strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
- The implementation intention formula is: I will {BEHAVIOUR} at {TIME} in {LOCATION}.
- Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
- The habit stacking formula is: After {CURRENT HABIT}, I will {NEW HABIT}.
### 6. Motivation is overrated; environment often matters more
#### Chapter Summary
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.
- Every habit in initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
- Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
- Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.
### 7. The secret to self-control
#### Chapter Summary
- The inversion of the 1st Law of behavior change is make it invisible.
- Once a habit if formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
- People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.
## The 2nd law: Make it attractive
### 8. How to make a habit irresistible
#### The Habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:
1. After {Current Habit}, I will {HABIT I NEED}.
2. After {HABIT I NEED}. I will {HABIT I WANT}
#### Chapter Summary
- The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is *make it attractive*.
- The more attractive an oppurtuinty is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.
- Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our mativation to act. 
- It is the anticipation of a reward - not the fulfillment of it - that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.
- Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you *want* to do with an action you *need* to do.
### 9. The role of family and friends in shaping your habits
#### Chapter Summary
- The culture we live in determines which behavrios are attractive to us.
- We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: 
	1. The close (family and friends)
	2. The many (tribe)
	3. The powerful (those with status and prestige)
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where
	1. your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour
	2. you already have something in common with the group
- The normal behaviour of the tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of the individual. Most days, we'd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.
- If a behaviour can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.
### 10. How to find and fix causes of your bad habits
#### Chapter Summary
- The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behaviour is *make it unattractive*.
- Every Behaviour has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.
- Your habtits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.
- The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unatrractive.
- Habits are attractive when we associate them with postive feelings, unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediatly before a difficult habit.
## The 3rd law: Make it easy
### 11. Walk slowly, but never backwards
#### Chapter Summary
- The 3rd Law of behavior change is *make it easy*.
- The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.
- Focus on taking action, not being in motion.
- Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic thriugh repitition.
- The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.
### 12. The law of least effort
#### Chapter Summary
- Human behavior follow the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.
- Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier.
### 13. How to stop procrastinating by using the two-minute rule
- Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact our behaviour for minutes or hours afterwards.
- Many habits occur at decisive moments - choices that are like a fork in the road - and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.
- The two minute rule states, "*When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do*".
- The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.
- Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that does'nt exist.
### 14. How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible
#### Chapter Summary
- The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is *make it difficult*.
- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.
- The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.
- Onetime choices - like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan - are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.
- Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.
## The 4th law: Make it satisfying
### 15. The cardinal rule of behavior change
#### Chapter Summary
- The 4th Law of Behavior is *make it satisfying.*
- Wea re more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.
- The cardinal Rule of Behavior change: *What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided*.
- To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful - even if it's in a small way.
- The first three laws of behavior change - *make it obvious, make it attractive* and *make it easy*  - increase the odds that a behavoir will be performed over time. The fourth law of behaviour change - *make it satisfying* - increases the odds that a behaviour will be repeated next time.
### 16. How to stick with good habits every day
#### How to keep your habits on track
1. Habit tracking is obvious
2. Habit tracking is attractive
3. Habit tracking is satisfying
#### Chapter Summary
- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit - like marking an X on a calendar.
- Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurment can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.
- Don't break the chan. Try to keep your habit streak alive.
- Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.
- Just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's the most important thing.
### 17. How an accountability partner can change everything
#### Chapter Summary
- The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior is *make it unattractive*.
- We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.
- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.
- A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.
- Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.
## Advanced Tactics: How to go from being merely good to being truly great
### 18. The truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't)
#### Chapter Summary
- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.
- Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.
- Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.
- Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you.
- Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can't find a game that favors you, create one.
- Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us *what* to work hard on.
### 19. The goldilocks rule: How to stay motivated in life and work
#### Chapter Summary
- The Goldilocks Rule states that human experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.
- As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored.
- Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going when work isn't exiting that makes the difference.
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
### 20. The downside of creating good habits
#### Chapter Summary
- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
- Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.
- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.
